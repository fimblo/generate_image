* A new take

In previous versions, the individual consisted of genes, which was actualized as an image. The image was compared with other images to see which individuals were better.

This time I'll try making the individuals and genes the actual canvas - the image itself. This way there won't be any "dead dna", where a shape was painted over another shape - making the proportion of useless genes go down to zero.

Of course, I've understood that these dead dna actually hold value in that they hold hidden variability - something I'll lose by testing this path (if this holds true)
