** DONE Radius strategy
   CLOSED: [2020-02-18 tis 13:06]
   - Start with XL radius strategy, and when it doesn't do enough, drop it and don't go back.
   - Same with L strategy - when it's not good enough, don't do that anymore
** DONE Clean up dead alleles
   CLOSED: [2020-02-18 tis 13:06]
   - a dead allele is one which is entirely occluded by a more recent
     circle.
   - Logically, if it was covered at some point and the distance went
     down, then it wasn't as good an allele. So it should be safe to remove.
   - However, I haven't thought it through entirely - since the BG
     image isn't homogenous, I think there's a situation where about
     half a circle matches the background.
** DONE Diversify the population.
   CLOSED: [2020-02-18 tis 13:06]
   - if no real change has occurred for quite some time, it's time to
     diversify the population, then let these diverse populations meet
     again.
